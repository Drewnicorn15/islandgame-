    "prompt": "You find yourself on the ground, surrounded by snow covered sand and the broken pieces of what you remember to be a boat. As you get up you see in the west, the smoke of a not so distant volcano rises. To the southeast, a taiga forest. You decide to head towards the taiga forest instead of the ominous volcano. As you move closer to the forest to begin to hear growls, it almost sounds like dogs until wolves with bone like structures on their heads, jump out from the bushes and trees, they begin moving towards you slowly; You begin to remember why you are on this island, the volcano is going to erupt and you need to save as many of these new species as possible. What are you going to do. Will you leave or will you stay",

            "prompt": "You continue running towards the path to the left, eventually losing the wolves and reaching a lake that's frozen over. The lake seems solid enough to walk on, and walking around you see another new species, a strange bunny-salamander hybrid, but you might not have enough time to escape if you waste time to get the animal, so you could go closer to another side of the forest or waste more time by going around to try to catch the animal. What will you do. Catch the animal, go around the lake, or go to another part of the forest.",
            "Catch Animal": "You begin sprinting across the lake when you begin hearing cracks but it's too  late, the ice breaks underneath your legs, and you fall in the freezing cold water, you try to get out but your hands are bloody from the shards and the ice is too slippery, as your legs get severe frostbite you die. Game Over",
            "Go": {
                "prompt": "You go to another part of the forest when you begin hearing heavy, loud footsteps, you look behind you to see a large mammoth-bull-like creature with white fur, your first instinct is to run and run, you do, to the edge of the island which is a snowfield. The snowfields are empty yet safe from the mamull and the boneheaded wolves, maybe you could stay a while to cool down but then the mamull comes out of the forest, but it hasn't seen you yet, you see some large shrubs and grass to your left where you can hide and wait it out or you could try to face the mamull down. Will you hide or will you fight",
                "Hide": "You run to the shrubs and lie down in them making sure you are a bit cover to further hide your position, the mamull continues to the pace the snowfields, minutes turn to hours and when the mamull finally leaves you realize you can’t move, frostbite has hit you and hypothermia begins setting in, and you die. Game Over",

                    "prompt": "You see a large stick and a sharp rock with a hole in it, you quickly run and make it into a makeshift spear and face the mamull, it begins to charge at you, you dodge and see it has a deep cut on the right side of its neck perfect to throw the spear at, but the mamull has once again turn around and begins charging. What will you do to survive. Will you Dodge or will you Throw",

You go to sleep. You wake up and decide to go to either the taiga or see if the volcano is going to erupt soon or not. Which one will you go to, taiga or volcano?",

Will you get the wood or will you save the skird.",
